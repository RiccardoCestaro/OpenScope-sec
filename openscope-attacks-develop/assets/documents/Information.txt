Welcome to openScope simulator with cyberattacks from ADS-B. <br> 
Secondly choose the global percentage of aircraft that will be affected by attacks. Remember this number
is not exact, more of an expected value. If you would like to change the distance of the jumping aircraft you
may change this value above at any time. Now play the simulator as you would normally. If you want to change 
the percentages of aircraft affected you may do that at any given time. <br> 
If you want to change the weight of different attacktypes you may choose the weights from 1 - 5.
You may also toggle the visibility attacking aircraft by the color code below <br> <br>
