# Aircraft separation

## General Separation

While in flight if there is not a more specific rule which applies
then aircraft must be separated by at least 3nm laterally or 1000 feet
vertically.  No separation incidents are registered for aircraft in
their first minute of flight.

A notice will occur for aircraft which do not have sufficient vertical
separation and are within 1nm of the applicable separation minimum
(usually 3nm).

Collisions occur when an aircraft is within approximately 160 feet of
another aircraft. At this time, aircraft on the ground are immune to
collisions.

## Diverging courses

Aircraft may approach closer if they are on courses which differ by at
least 15 degrees and one aircraft has passed the point where the
courses intersect.  If the headings differ by more than 165 degrees,
then the aircraft may approach closer once the distance between them
is increasing.

## Opposite direction runway usage

A warning will be issued if two aircraft within 6 miles of each other
are using the same runway from different ends (by checking heading).

## Reduced lateral separation during runway approach

Aircraft "established" on the localizer of an Instrument Landing System
(ILS) are often eligible for reduced separation minima from other aircraft
on adjacent final approach courses. Aircraft are considered to be fully
"established" when they are laterally within 160 feet of the final
approach course. At this point, the lower lateral separation requirements
will be applied, allowing the aircraft to go under 3nm separation, all the
way down to the appropriate value (depends on distance between runway
centerlines):
