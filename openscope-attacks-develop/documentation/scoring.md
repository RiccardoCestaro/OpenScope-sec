# Scoring

Scoring is based on many separate variables. The score is computed by
summing all of the variables after multiplying each one by its own
unique factor (so that a fatal collision docks many more points than a
crosswind landing, for example.)

## Arrival

Each arriving aircraft that is successfully landed gives you 10 points.

## Departure

Each departing aircraft that is successfully routed out of the airspace
with a clearance onto their filed departure route earns you 10 points.

## Failed Departures

We must clear all aircraft onto their flightplan route before they leave
our airspace. If they exit the airspace without being cleared to their
desired fix (usually we do this via a SID), you will lose 10 points.

## Windy landings

When an aircraft is forced to land with a crosswind or a tailwind, you
lose 0.5 points per knot, multiplied by the angle (i.e. if it's a
direct headwind, you lose 0 points; if it's a direct 10kt tailwind,
you lose 5 points.)

## Windy takeoffs

Calculated the same as Windy landings, above.

## Failed arrival

You lose 20 points for every arriving aircraft that leaves the area
(and therefore hadn't landed).

## Warning

Any time a warning is issued for an aircraft 5 points are lost.  The
most common warning is when two aircraft are separated by less 3
nautical miles or less than 1000 feet of altitude.  However there are
a number of situations where aircraft can be separated by less, for
complete details refer to the
[aircraft separation rules](aircraft-separation.md)

## Collisions

50 points are lost whenever two aircraft collide (within 50 or so feet
vertically and 165 feet laterally).

## Aborted landing

5 points are lost for each aircraft that is forced to go around during
landing. This only applies to aircraft that are closer than about 6
miles to the runway they're landing at (to roughly approximate short
final).

## Aborted taxi

2 points are lost whenever an aircraft's taxiing is aborted (i.e. when
you want to assign it a different runway.)
