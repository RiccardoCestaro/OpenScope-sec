This level 9 combined TRACON/ATCT facility controls a number of airfields in Greater Raleigh. Since this is a combined facility, the TRACON and ATC Tower are co-located at Raleigh-Durham International Airport (KRDU).

### Airspace
The RDU TRACON airspace encompasses a large area around Great Raleigh extending from the surface up to 12,000 feet. Class C airspace exists with tops of 4,400 feet over the Raleigh and Durham areas.

### Instrument Procedures
Although departing aircraft must be vectored to their initial fixes, the STARs are very automated, taking a lot of weight off the controllers. Arrivals must still be vectored to their final approach course.
