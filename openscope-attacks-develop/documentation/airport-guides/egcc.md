### About the Manchester Area Control Centre
The Manchester Area Control Centre controls most aircraft over the north of England, the Midlands and North Wales between 2,500ft and FL285. It is located in the operations centre of NATS in Prestwick, hence the callsign "Scottish Control". The west sector is available for you to control within openScope.

### Standard Operating Procedures
###### Preferential Runway
Runways 23L and R should be used for all movements when the tailwind component is not greater than 5kt on the runway or at 2000ft.
During dual-runway operations, 23L should be used for takeoffs and 23R for landing. Dual-runway operations should only be used during peak times or in exceptional circumstances. Otherwise, single-runway operations is in use where 23R is used for both takeoffs and landings, as runway 23L does not have an Instrument Landing System.

##### Noise Limits
Each aircraft should, after takeoff be operated method possible. Aircraft exceeding the following noise restrictions will be fined £750 sterling, plus an additional £150 for each decibel thereafter.

|  Time (local) | Maximum level in decibels |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------:|
|  0600 - 0700  |           82              |
|  0700 - 2300  |           90              |
