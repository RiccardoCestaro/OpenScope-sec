Non-RNAV departures apply to all runways.

### Airports of Interest

#### KABQ (Primary Airport)
Albuquerque International Sunport  
134,992 annual operations

Albuquerque Sunport is the largest commercial airport in the state of New Mexico, handling almost 5 million passengers anually. Since 1940, the airport shares its three runways with Kirtland Air Force Base, which also handles rescue and firefighting operations. Runway 3/21 is the primary runway for both departures and arrivals, although runway 8/26 can also be used in heavy traffic conditions. Due to high terrain to the East of the airfield, ILS approaches are not possible into runways 21 and 26, so RNAV approaches are normally used instead.
