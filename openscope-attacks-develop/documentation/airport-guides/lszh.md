### About this facility
Skyguide Air Navigation Center, Dübendorf, Switzerland
269,160 annual operations in 2016

Located at Dübendorf Air Base (close to Zurich), besides the LSAZ FIR, the Skyguide Air Navigation Center is also responsible for the in- and outbound traffic of Switzerlands major airport Zurich (LSZH).

### Airspace
The airspace encompasses a large area around Zurich up to FL190. It includes a fairly large shelf to the East with a floor of FL100. The airspace below it, is used by the ARFA sector which controls EDNY and LSZR. Zurich airspace also includes some German territory to the North which is heavily used for approaches to runways 14 and 16. During the German curfew period runways 28 or 34 must be used which reduces the capacity of the airport.

### Instrument Procedures
LSZH offers several departure procedures, however the DEGES and VEBIT departures are the most commonly used. Arrivals follow their STARs to either GIPOL or AMIKI, where aircraft must be vectored to their final approach course.

Zürich Airport, also known as Kloten Airport, is the largest international airport of Switzerland and the principal hub of Swiss International Air Lines. It serves Zürich, Switzerland's largest city, and, with its surface transport links, much of the rest of the country. The airport is located 13 kilometres (8 mi) north of central Zürich, in the municipalities of Kloten, Rümlang, Oberglatt, Winkel and Opfikon, all of which are within the canton of Zürich. Heavy aircraft may use runway 16 for departure if it is needed due to performance requirements, but departures out of runway 28 have priority. Runway 10 is only used in special weather conditions.

This means that no jet aircraft squadron is stationed in Emmen, but the airfield is still used as a training and alternate air base. The air base is, at both end of the runway, equipped with retractable arresting gear devices (used by the F/A-18 and in case of a problem by the F-5).
