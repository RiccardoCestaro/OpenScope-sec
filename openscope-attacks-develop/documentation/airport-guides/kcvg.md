### Airports of Interest

#### KCVG (Primary Airport)
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport    
419,508 annual operations

Serving the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan area, CVG is the fastest-growing cargo airport in North America. Although commercial operations at the airport decreased drastically between 2006 and 2013, the airport has been growing back slowly, having moved almost 8 million passengers in 2017. Although this is still far from the 22 million yearly passengers that CVG moved in the early 2000s, the airport hopes to increase cargo activity and grow traffic to 9 million annual passengers by 2021. Amazon Air is also planning on developing 920 acres of land at CVG in order to construct a 3 million sq. ft. sorting facility and ramp space for 100 cargo aircraft by 2050.

##### Instrument Procedures
Most procedures at CVG are heavily automated, so controllers should focus mainly on the separation between departing and arriving aircraft, as well as providing vectors and descent clearances for aircraft on approach.

##### Runway Configuration
KCVG has 4 lengthy runways; 3 parallel North-South runways (18L/C/R - 36/L/C/R), and 1 crosswind East-West runway (9-27). Despite its four long runways, Cincinnati often uses just one or two for both arrivals and departures, due its low traffic numbers. If necessary however, Cincinnati is able to support triple simultaneous approaches on its parallel runways. In openScope, KCVG is running a south configuration, meaning that runway 18L is the primary runway for arrivals and departures, with the occasional use of runway 18C mainly for arrivals from the West.

#### KLUK
Cincinnati Municipal Airport â€“ Lunken Field  
83,753 annual operations  
12.1nm East of KCVG

When the 1,000 acre (400 ha) airfield first opened in 1925, it was the largest municipal airfield in the world. The Embry-Riddle Company was formed at Lunken Airport, which later moved to Florida to become the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. During the Ohio River flood of 1937, the airfield and two-story main terminal building were submerged, giving it the nickname of "Sunken Lunken". Today the old control tower is home to the Lunken Cadet Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol, and is the oldest standing control tower in the United States. The airfield now primarily serves private and general aviation around the Cincinnati area.
