### About this facility
Kansas City Combined TRACON and ATCT (KC/MCI), Kansas City, Missouri, USA
213,727 annual operations in 2017 (<a href="https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Tracon.asp" target="_blank">FAA ATADS</a>)

This level 9 combined TRACON/ATCT facility controls 19 airfields around Kansas City, 5 of which have control towers. Since this is a combined facility, the TRACON and ATC Tower are co-located at Kansas City International Airport (KMCI).

### Airspace
The KC TRACON airspace encompasses a large area around Kansas City extending from the surface up to 15,000 feet. It also contains two shelves; The South Shelf, from the surface up to 5,000ft, and the North Shelf, which sits on top of St. Joseph (KSTJ). When the airport is open, the North Shelf, up to 6,000ft, is delegated to St. John Approach, otherwise it is controlled by the KC TRACON up to 15,000ft.

Class B airspace exists with tops of 8,000 feet over the Kansas City area.

### Instrument Procedures
The procedures at MCI are somewhat automated, with the design of the SIDs and STARs taking some weight off the controllers. Departing aircraft must be vectored to specified routes depicted on charts and controllers must issue arriving aircraft descent clearances and vectors to their final approach course.
