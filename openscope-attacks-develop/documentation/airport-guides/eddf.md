##### Arrivals
Frankfurt primarily uses the transitions to position aircraft onto downwind or base legs to establish onto instrument procedures for the runways. The STARs are rarely used; they are generally used in the case that an aircraft has lost communications.

Transitions with the suffix 07N/25N are used to sequence aircraft for arrival onto 07L/25R; 07S/25S for 07C/25C and 07R/25L.
