### About this facility
Las Vegas TRACON (L30), Las Vegas, Nevada, USA
606,732 annual operations in 2016 (<a href="https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Tracon.asp" target="_blank">FAA ATADS</a>)

Located beside Terminal 1 in the same building as the LAS control tower, this consolidated approach control facility works all traffic in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.

### Airspace
The L30 TRACON covers a fairly large area south of KLAS up to FL190. Class B airspace exists with tops of 10,000 over the Las Vegas metropolitan area, with a fairly complex structure designed to deconflict noncommunicative VFR traffic from IFR arrivals on arrival and departure procedures in and out of the valley.

Due to nearby Nellis Air Force Base (KLSV), just 11nm north of KLAS, the L30 TRACON does not extend north of Las Vegas. This also means that runways 19L/R are almost never used for arrivals, even when the winds are favourable for such configuration.

### Instrument Procedures
For an American airport, the procedures are fairly automated, with the design of the SIDs and STARs taking a lot of weight off the controllers. Aircraft climb and descend via the procedures, and by design the traffic flow requires minimal intervention other than running the final.
