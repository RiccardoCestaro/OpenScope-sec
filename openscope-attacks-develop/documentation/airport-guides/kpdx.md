### About this facility
Portland TRACON (P80), Portland, Oregon, USA
316,542 annual operations in 2017 (<a href="https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Tracon.asp" target="_blank">FAA ATADS</a>)

The P80 TRACON provides approach control service to over twenty public/municipal airports, as well as a myriad of active private airports/airstrips.

### Airspace
The Portland TRACON airspace includes a thirty-five mile radius around PDX, and extends from the surface up to 15,000 feet.

Class C airspace exists with tops of 4,000 feet over the Portland/Vancouver area.

### Instrument Procedures
For an American airport, the procedures are fairly automated, with the design of the SIDs and STARs taking a lot of weight off the controllers. Most aircraft climb and descend via the procedures, and by design the traffic flow requires minimal intervention other than running the final. Aircraft are still manually vectored to the final approach course.

### Sectors Available in openScope
