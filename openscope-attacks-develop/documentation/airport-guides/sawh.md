# SAWH - Malvinas Argentinas Ushuaia International Airport

## About SAWH
Malvinas Argentinas Ushuaia International Airport is the world's southernmost international airport, located 4km south of the center of Ushuaia, a small remote city on the island of Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. The airport's controversial name reflects Argentina's claims of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas). The airport was opened in 1995 with the aim of serving all commercial traffic to Ushuaia. Previously, all traffic was handled by the Ushuaia Aeronautical Base, located just North of SAWH, but it's runway proved to be inadequate for civil aviation, due to its size and orientation. Ushuaia International Airport's only runway (07/25) was designed to comfortably accommodate the numerous Boeing 747s which would fly in from many European cities. Two chartered Air France Concordes also visited Ushuaia in 1999. Although most of the traffic today is made up of domestic flights from other cities in Argentina, it is often used by passengers from all over the world as a cruise-ship gateway to the Antarctic.

## About Ushuaia TMA
The Ushuaia Terminal Maneuvering Area controls a relatively small, mostly rectangular area covering the Beagle Channel and the southern part of Tierra del Fuego from the surface up to FL450. It borders Río Grande TMA to the North and East and the Punta Arenas FIR to the South and West. However, in practice, a much larger area from the Río Grande TMA and the Punta Arenas FIR is delegated to the Ushuaia TMA for arrivals into Ushuaia, resulting in the 78nm-wide circular airspace available in openScope.

## Instrument Procedures
Due to the challenging terrain surrounding Ushuaia, all departure procedures take aircraft over the Beagle Channel to gain some altitude before turning towards their departure waypoints. There is just one arrival into Ushuaia, DABLI2, which takes aircraft from the North border of the TMA onto the ILS for RWY25. It contains strict altitude restrictions for terrain avoidance.
