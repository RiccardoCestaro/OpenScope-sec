## Positions
Not much is known about Halifax due to lack of local knowledge, however from <a href="https://www.liveatc.net/search/?icao=CYHZ" target="_blank">LiveATC feeds</a>, we know that Halifax Terminal on frequency 119.200MHz is used most.

## About the Halifax Terminal Control Areas

NAVCanada outlines the airspace boundary around Halifax in their Designated Airspace Handbook. All radar positions (departure, arrival) surrounding Halifax have the callsign "Halifax Terminal". Aircraft leaving the Halifax TCA should be handed over to Moncton Centre.

## Instrument Procedures

Halifax has one Standard Instrument Departure and four Standard Terminal Arrival Routes.

### Departures

All departing aircraft will be assigned the Halifax Four departure. The Halifax Four advises pilots to climb to 5000ft on runway heading. Upon receipt of an aircraft on departure, Halifax Terminal should:

* give a direct to a point along the filed route;
* give vectors to a point along the filed route;
* issue climb instructions.

### Arrivals

Moncton Centre will assign STARs to aircraft and will give initial descent instructions.

Halifax Terminal is responsible for the following:

* issuing further descent clearances;
* clearing aircraft onto a final approach, ILS, RNAV, Visual or LOC;
* ensuring aircraft have sufficient spacing between them.

Where possible, Terminal should issue descent clearances to meet the following restrictions:

* Runway 05
  * 5000' at PEPTA
* Runway 14
  * 5000' at VIMLA
  * 5000' at ILOTA
* Runway 23
  * 5000' at RUDBU
  * 5000' at PEPTA
  * 5000' at LOGPO
* Runway 32
  * 5000' at MENVO
  * 5000' at EBLUV
  * 5000' at NOTUB

The following fixes are Final Approach Course Fixes, meaning that aircraft can be cleared for an approach after these fixes:

* ODKAS -> LOC, NDB or RNAV 05
* TETAR -> ILS or RNAV 14
* LEROS -> ILS, RNAV or NDB 23
* VOKIL -> RNAV 32

There are various transitions which can bring aircraft from an Initial Approach Fix to a FACF or onto approach:

| Runway | Type of Approach |       Transition names     |
|--------|:----------------:|:--------------------------:|
|   05   |   LOC, RNAV(Z)   |        OBNOM, HOROW        |
|        |     RNAV (Y)     |        PEPTA, GOSUG        |
|   14   |   ILS, RNAV(Z)   |        MODIR, IGVOP        |
|        |     RNAV (Y)     |        ILOTA, VIMLA        |
|   23   |   ILS, RNAV(Z)   |        DUTIR, OTVUV        |
|        |     RNAV (Y)     |        LOGPO, RUDBU        |
|   32   |     RNAV (Z)     |        EMBAX, GABAP        |
|        |     RNAV (Y)     | NOTUB, EBLUV, MENVO, AVRIX |

## Sectors Available in openScope

`Halifax Terminal`

## Restricted Airspace

There are three restricted airspaces within the Halifax TCAs, CYR717, CYR 747 and CYR748.

### CYR717 Halifax, Nova Scotia

CYR717 is the airspace within a circle of radius 0.75nm centred on N44°42'43.00" W063°38'04.00", between the surface and 1,700'.
This is a continuous restriction; aircraft are not permitted to operate within CYR717 without permission from the Controlling Agency.

This location contains a Candian navy base, CFB Halifax.

### CYR747 Truro, Nova Scotia

CYR747 is the airspace within a circle of radius 1nm centred on N45°20'50.00" W063°18'10.00", between the surface and 1,300'.
This is a continuous restriction; no person should operate an aircraft within the area described unless the flight has been authorised by the Controlling Agency.

Within the area is a federal prison for women.

### CYR748 Halifax, Nova Scotia

CYR748 is the airspace bounded by the following coordinates:
N44°36'06.00" W063°26'06.00" to
N44°32'41.00" W063°25'15.00" to
N44°26'54.00" W063°10'48.00" to
N44°36'54.00" W063°05'00.00" to
N44°38'00.00" W063°24'30.00" to
N44°36'06.00" W063°26'06.00"

The restriction applies between the surface and 1,500'.

A NOTAM will be issued when this restriction is enforced; no person should operate an aircraft within the area unless the flight has been authorised by the Controlling Agency.

This area is mostly over water; there appears to be some sort of naval presence here.

## Other aerodromes within the Halifax TCA

### Debert Airport, CCQ3

Debert Airport is a small airport to the north of the Halifax TCA. It started off as a military base in 1941. The airport and the land around it was purchased by the Government of Nova Scotia. In 1972, The Truro Flying Club was formed and one of its divisions provide training to pilots today. The airport has three runways, 05/23 (3,144ft), 09/27 (5,000ft) and 16/34 (5,001ft).

### CFB Shearwater, CYAW

CFB Shearwater is a Canadian Forces Base. It was previously known as Shearwater Heliport until operations here were scaled back in the mid-1990s. The runways here have been opened and closed various times, but today it has one runway for helicopters, runway 16H-34H and four other helipads.

## Videomap

Provided with the videomap is a top down view of the airport's taxiways and runway. Each dashed line on the extended centrelines represents one (1) nautical mile, with each "T" representing four (4) nautical miles.

The videomap also contains:

* Top down view of Debert Airport (CCQ3);
* Runway 16H-34H of Shearwater Heliport;
* All restricted airspaces;
* Circles around VORs.
