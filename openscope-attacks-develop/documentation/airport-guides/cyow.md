### Instrument Procedures
##### Departures
The only departure Ottawa has is the Ottawa 4 departure, which is a vector departure. When cleared for the Ottawa Four departure, pilots should climb to an altitude of 3000' on runway heading.

The Ottawa Four for runway 14 states that there should be no left turn below 1000'.

##### Arrivals
Montreal Centre will assign STARs to aircraft and will give initial descent instructions.

Ottawa Arrivals is responsible for the following:
* issuing further descent clearances;
* clearing aircraft onto a final approach, ILS, RNAV, Visual or LOC;
* ensuring aircraft have sufficient spacing between them.

The various advised altitude restrictions can be found on charts. Charts are available for free from <a href="https://www.czul.ca/charts" target="_blank">VATCAN's Montreal FIR</a>

The following fixes are Final Approach Course Fixes, meaning that aircraft can be cleared for an approach after these fixes:
* TEFLY - RNAV 25
* RAFNO - RNAV 14
* TEXEN - ILS 32, RNAV 32
* VISOL - ILS 07, RNAV 07
