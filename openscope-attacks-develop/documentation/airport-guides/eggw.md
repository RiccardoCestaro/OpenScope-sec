##### London Gatwick, EGKK
London Gatwick Airport is a major international airport 47.5km south of Central London. It is the second-busiest airport by passenger traffic in the United Kingdom.

Gatwick has tried to lobby for a third runway,however a 40 year agreement not to build one was made in 1979 with the local council. Another runway would allow Gatwick to handle more passengers than Heathrow does today.
