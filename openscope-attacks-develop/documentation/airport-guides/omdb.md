### About the Dubai Control Areas
The airspace boundaries for the Dubai Control Areas are enlisted within ENR 2.1 of the United Arab Emirates AIP, available from the <a href="https://www.gcaa.gov.ae/en/ais/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">General Civil Aviation Authority</a>.

### Standard Operating Procedures
###### Preferential Runway
As mentioned previously, Dubai is the world's busiest dual runway airport in terms of traffic. It is common to see one runway designated to departures, and one designated to arrivals. However, it is not uncommon for a few aircraft to land on the departure runway.

When parallel runway operations are in use, one runway should be used for departures, the other for arrivals.

When winds favour the operation of runways 12L/R:
- 12L for landing
- 12R for takeoff

When winds favour the operation of runways 30L/R:
- 30L for landing
- 30R for takeoff

In openScope, a 30 configuration is simulated, with aircraft automatically being assigned runways according to their flight type (departure/arrival). A few arriving aircraft will be automatically assigned 30R.

###### Low Visibility Operations
Low Visibility Operations are enforced when any of the following criteria is met:
- Touchdown RVR readings indicate a visibility of 600m or below
- METAR visibility indicates visibility of 600m or less
- Reported cloud ceiling is less than 300ft.

In this situation, runway 30L/12R are used for landing and 30R/12L are used for takeoff, with the ILS for the departing runway disabled.

##### Speed Restrictions
According to the AIP, "ATC has zero tolerance with regards to the compliance with speed control instructions. Pilots shall adhere to the speed (IAS) approved or assigned by ATC and shall request ATC approval before making any changes thereto".

Air Traffic Control would normally issue the following speed control restrictions:
* 210 – 250 KT: from CTA entry to downwind;
* 180 – 230 KT: from downwind to base leg;
* 160 – 210 KT: on base leg and closing heading to final approach;
* 180 KT: 10 NM from touchdown;
* 160 KT: 4 NM from touchdown

All speed restrictions on the STAR coding tables will be followed by the pilot automatically. These can only be bypassed with permission.

For departures, the restriction is 250KT below 10,000ft.

##### Reduced Wake Turbulence Separation for Parallel Approaches
|     Leading Aircraft 30L     | Trailing Aircraft 30R | Minimum Separation |
| any wake turbulance category |   Super Heavy/Heavy   |   None required    |
|            Heavy             |         Medium        |     2.5nm/3nm      |
|         Super Heavy          |         Medium        |       4.5nm        |
|            Medium            |         Medium        |       2.5nm        |

### Instrument Procedures
Dubai's instrument procedures all require aircraft to have RNAV capabilities. Furthermore, Dubai's procedures require almost little input from the controller; climb and descent instructions must be issued by the controller. Vectors are rarely used, as all STARs end on the extended centrelines, where an approach clearance (ie. ILS approach) can be issued. Shortcuts on downwind may be given, if possible.

### Other aerodromes within the Dubai CTA
##### Sharjah International Airport, OMSJ/SHJ
Sharjah International Airport is the third largest Middle East airfreight hub in terms of cargo handled, according to 2015 statistics from Airports Council International. It is also base to low-cost carrier Air Arabia, who have a headquarters in the Sharjah Freight Centre on the premises. The airport is 15km from Central Dubai.

Runway 12/30 - 4060m, Asphalt

11,993,887 passengers handled in 2015
586,195 tonnes of cargo handled in 2015
98,786 aircraft movements in 2015

##### Al Minhad Air Base, OMDM/NHD
Al Minhad Air Base is a military base operated by the United Arab Emirates Air Force, located 24km to the South of Dubai. The base also supports Australian operations within the Middle East.

Runway 09/27 - 3,953m, Asphalt

##### Al Maktoum International Airport, OMDW/DWC
Al Maktoum International is an international airport located 37km South of Dubai, which opened in late-June 2010. It is the core piece of Dubai World Central, a planned mixed-use complex for residential, commercial and logistical purposes. The airport is planned to expand; the initial plan was to build 6 runways in total, but this number was reduced to 5. Up to four aircraft will be able to land simultaneously. DWC will complement Dubai International, and the two airports will be connected by high-speed rail, light railway and by the Dubai Metro.

As of current, the airport mainly serves cargo flights, hence the area's specialisation in logistics. However, a few passenger airlines operate flights seasonally, with Wizz Air and flydubai being the main commercial operators out of DWC. In the future, the airport will have 3 terminals, one dedicated to Emirates, one to other carriers, and the final one for low-cost carriers. In addition, the airport will be able to house A380 aircraft.

### Videomap
In the videomap, there is a top down view of the airport's runways. Each dashed line on the extended centrelines represents one (1) nautical mile, with each small "T" representing four (4) nautical miles.

The videomap also contains:
* All restricted airspaces
* Extended centreline and runway for Sharjah International Airport
* Extended centreline and runway for Al Maktoum International Airport
* Extended centreline and runway for Ras Al Khaimah International Airport (outside Dubai CTA)
* All the borders of the airspaces that are contained within the Dubai CTA
* Entry points/exit points of aircraft in the Dubai CTA via STARs/SIDs

* Section of the Dubai Coastline with the Palm Jebel Ali and the Palm Jumeirah
