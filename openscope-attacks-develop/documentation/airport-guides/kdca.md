### About the Potomac Consolidated TRACON
The Potomac Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control is a FAA air traffic control facility which provides radar services to the Washington D.C. and Special Fight Rules Area. The PCT is a combination of four TRACON facilities for the regionâ€™s four major airports; Washington Dulles (IAD), Washington National (DCA), Baltimore-Washington (BWI) and Richmond (RIC).

##### Washington Dulles (KIAD, IAD)
Washington Dulles International Airport is an international airport 26 miles west of downtown Washington. Dulles handles 90% of all international traffic within the Baltimore-Washington region, with 60,000 passengers passing through its airport daily with routes to/from more than 125 international destinations.

The Shenandoah (SHD) area of the PCT primarily serves IAD.

##### Baltimore-Washington International Airport (KBWI, BWI)
Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport is 9 miles south of downtown Baltimore and 32 miles northeast of Washington. BWI handles the most passengers out of all the three major airports within the Baltimore-Washington area. The airport handled 248,585 aircraft movements in 2015-2016; the majority of those flights being operated by Southwest Airlines, which has a fortress hub here.

Chesapeake (CHP) covers Baltimore and the northern area of the PCT.

##### Richmond International Airport (KRIC, RIC)
Richmond International Airport is the smallest of the four major airports within the Potomac Consolidated TRACON, 7 miles southeast of downtown Richmond. During 2015-2016 it handled 3,818,759 passengers across 10,073 aircraft movements.

The area of the PCT which covers Richmond is the James River (JRV) area, which also covers the southern area of the PCT.

### Statistics
Handled 70m+ passengers in 2015-2016
800,000+ aircraft movements in 2015-2016

### Primary Airport :: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is an airport just 3 miles south of downtown Washington. It covers 861 hectares, acting as a fortress hub for American Airlines.

In an effort to send more air traffic to the larger Washington Dulles Airport, flights in and out of the airport must not exceed 1,250 statute miles in any direction. There are a few exemptions issued by The US Department of Transportation.

There are no international routes from DCA; the only international flights that go to DCA are business jets that must depart from US Customs and Border Protection pre-clearance facilities.

The airport is known by many pilots for its River Visual procedure for runway 19 which requires at least 3 statute miles of visibility. It uses the Potomac River and various bridges including the Roosevelt Bridge, Memorial Bridge, Rochambeau Bridge and more.

### Mount Vernon Area
The Mount Vernon Area is the part of the Potomac PCT which mainly covers DCA. The airspace is relatively large, so <a href="https://image.prntscr.com/image/fRaW9wieSJ_Ibi9KRix4Kg.png" target="_blank">here is a diagram</a>] of the airspace that Mount Vernon owns.

### Instrument Procedures
##### Departures
DCA has various instrument departures which are all available for usage in openScope. The only departure which is not assigned automatically is the National Seven departure as it is rarely used.

Washington National has very strict noise restrictions, however security is the number one priority. The areas around the National Mall and US Naval Observatory are both prohibited airspace with a ceiling of 18,000ft. This means that aircraft departing to the North must climb quickly and sharply turn left.

##### Arrivals
There are 9 Standard Terminal Arrival Routes into Reagan National Airport.

Unfortunately it isn't possible to simulate the RIVER 3 approach for runway 19; runway 01 is preferred for departure and arrival in openScope.

There are various restrictions along the arrivals for DCA, pilots are expected to descend to meet those instructions when they are cleared to "descend via the STAR".

It's also worth looking at fix names for a few of the STARs such as the FRDMM3, NUMMY2 and TRUPS3 arrivals which were introduced to honour those who died in the September 11th attacks.
