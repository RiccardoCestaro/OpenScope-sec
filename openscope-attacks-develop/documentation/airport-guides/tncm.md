# TNCM - Princess Juliana International Airport

## About TNCM
Princess Juliana International Airport (IATA: SXM, ICAO: TNCM) is the main airport on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin/Sint Maarten. The airport is located on the Dutch side of the island. It is named after Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, who landed there while still only heir presumptive in 1944. Due to high terrain to the East, arriving aircraft approach the airport from the West, flying low over the famous Maho Beach. The proximity of Maho Beach to the runway has made the airport one of the world's favorite places among planespotters despite the dangers.

## About the Juliana TMA
The Juliana Terminal Maneuvering Area controls a relatively small area within the San Juan CERAP covering the island of Saint Martin/Sint Maarten as well as some of the surrounding islands up to FL150. The airspace also borders the Piarco FIR to the Southeast.

## Instrument Procedures
Due to the high terrain East of Princess Juliana Airport, all departure procedures out of RWY10 instruct aircraft to turn right towards the ocean as soon as practicable to gain some altitude before turning towards their departure waypoints. In order to separate jet aircraft from propeller aircraft, different departure procedures are used for different aircraft types. In general, propeller aircraft fly Southwest after departure (BOPAT2 and MULLT2 departures), allowing jet aircraft to depart without delay to the South (MODOR2 departure). There is just one standard arrival into TNCM, ULUBA1, which takes aircraft from the borders of the TMA onto the VOR Approach for RWY10, although radar vectors are usually given to guide aircraft into Sint Maarten.

25nm Southwest of TNCM  

The airport, named after the Aruban Minister Juancho Irausquin, has the shortest commercial runway in the world, only 400 meters (1,312 ft) long, flanked on one side by high hills, with cliffs that drop into the sea at both ends. Although the airport is closed to jet traffic, regional airline propeller aircraft are able to land there under waivers from The Netherlands Antilles' Civil Aviation Authority. The most common aircraft to land there are the STOL-capable de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and BN-2 Islander.
