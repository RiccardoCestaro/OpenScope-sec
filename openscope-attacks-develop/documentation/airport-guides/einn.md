### About Shannon
Shannon Airport is an international airport serving the Mid-West of Ireland. It is located 27 km from Limerick city centre, on a peninsula jutting out from the northern shore of the Shannon estuary.

The airport was initially know as Rineanna when it opened in 1936, when the Irish Government realised that a permanent runway would be required, and selected a site across the estuary from the Foynes flying boat terminal. The airport is owned by the Irish Government and is operated as a commercial entity as Shannon Group Plc.

The airport and runways have increased in size since its foundation, having the longest runway in Ireland which was a designated landing site for the US Space Shuttle. Only the 06-24 runway is now in use.
