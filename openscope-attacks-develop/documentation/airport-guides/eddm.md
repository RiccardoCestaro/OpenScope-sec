### About Munich Airport (MUC | EDDM)
Munich Airport (German: Flughafen München) is the international airport of Munich, the capital of Bavaria, Germany. It is the second-busiest airport in Germany in terms of passenger traffic after Frankfurt Airport, and the seventh-busiest airport in Europe. Munich Airport serves as a hub for Lufthansa including Lufthansa Regional and its Star Alliance partners. The airport is located 28.5 km (17.7 mi) northeast of Munich near the city of Freising.

#### Statistics (2018)

* **Total passengers**: *46,253,623*
* **Aircraft movements**: *413,469*
* **Cargo**: *368,377 tonnes*

### About the facility
There are four Area Control Centers in Germany: Bremen, Langen, Karlsruhe and München, operated by the Deutsche Flugsicherung (German Air Traffic Control). The terminal control service for EDDM is provided by the München ACC which is located at the airport. München ACC also provides terminal control services for Oberpfaffenhofen Airport (EDMO) and Augsburg Airport (EDMA) as well as air traffic services for en-route traffic within the München Flight Information Region (EDMM FIR).

### Airspace
The airspace encompasses a large area around Munich up to FL195. Big parts of the airspace are classified as Class C airspace (equivalent to American class B airspace). As long as one approach radar system (ASR) is in operation, 3nm horizontal separation may be applied.

### Runways
EDDM consists of two parallel concrete runways (08R/26L and 08L/26R). Both runways are equal in length (4000m / 13123ft) and width (60m / 197ft) and are equipped with instrument landing systems in both directions. A third runway north-east of 08R/26L is planned but construction has not yet begun due to protests by residents.

#### Runway usage
Runways 26L and 26R are preferentially used as long as the tailwind component does not exceed 5 knots. The runways are approved for independent departure and independent parallel approach operations. Radar separation of at least 3nm and/or 1000ft vertical separation has to be maintained until both aircraft are established on the localizer.  

* Departures/arrivals from/to the north are usually assigned to the northern runway (08L/26R).
* Departures/arrivals from/to the south are usually assigned to the southern runway (08R/26L).

Exceptions are aircraft that are positioned at the stand-groups 700/800/900 (mostly cargo and general aviation) which are usually assigned to the southern runway due to shorter taxi time. Also some SIDs are always assigned to the southern runway (see also "Instrument Procedures").

### Instrument Procedures

#### Departures

EDDM has a variety of standard instrument departures. However, there are certain rules to which runway an aircraft should be assigned:

\* Preferred departure route  
¹ Non-jet aircraft  
² For aircraft unable to comply with restrictions of the "S"-suffix SID


#### Arrivals

EDDM offers a variety of standard terminal arrival routes that lead to one of the four arrival gates: ROKIL, NAPSA, BETOS, LANDU. These waypoints are clearance limits. If no further clearance is issued by the controller aircraft have to enter the published hold. After the arrival gate transitions (e.g. ROKIL26), specific terminal waypoints (DMxxx) or radar vectors are used to guide the aircraft to the ILS.

| Arrival gate | Preferential runway | Transition |         |
|:------------:|:-------------------:|:----------:|:-------:|
|     ROKIL    |       08L/26R       |   ROKIL26  | ROKIL08 |
|     LANDU    |       08L/26R       |   LANDU26  | LANDU08 |
|     NAPSA    |       08R/26L       |   NAPSA26  | NAPSA08 |
|     BETOS    |       08R/26L       |   BETOS26  | BETOS08 |

**Note**:

Detached from reality, the airport file has been modified: Aircraft do not enter the published hold at the arrival gate since users might not have enough time in high-traffic situations to clear the aircraft for the transition due to airspace structure.
