### About this facility
Pittsburgh Combined TRACON and ATCT (PIT), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA
274,965 annual operations in 2017 (<a href="https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Tracon.asp" target="_blank">FAA ATADS</a>)

This level 9 combined TRACON/ATCT facility controls several airfields around "Steel City". Although the yearly operations have been decreasing for the last 15 years, the facility still handles a large amount of traffic in and out of the Pittsburgh area.

### Airspace
The Pittsburgh TRACON airspace encompasses a thirty mile radius around Pittsburgh Airport and extends from the surface up to 15,000 feet.
Class B airspace exists with tops of 8,000 feet over the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, designed to deconflict noncommunicative VFR traffic from IFR traffic on arrival and departure procedures in and out of the "City of Bridges".

### Instrument Procedures
The airport contains only one standardized departure (PIT3), which requires aircraft to be vectored to a series of depicted fixes. Although 4 RNAV STAR's are available, controllers must give aircraft descent clearances and vectors to their final approach course.
