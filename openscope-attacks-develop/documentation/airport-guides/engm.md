### About this facility
Oslo TMA, RÃ¸yken, Norway
237,618 annual operations in 2016 (Reported by Avinor)

The Oslo TMA is one of three sectors of the Oslo Kontrollsentral (ATCC), responsible for all airspace in Eastern Norway. The Oslo ATCC is located 30km from Oslo and 65km Southwest of Oslo Gardemoen Airport (ENGM).

### Airspace
The Oslo TMA consists of Class C airspace (equivalent to American class B airspace) which covers a large area on top of Akershus County and the Oslo metropolitan area up to FL215. It also includes a small shelf to the South with a floor of FL115; below this, the airspace is ceded to the Tarris TMA.

### Instrument Procedures
The procedures are quite modern for a European airport. All SIDs and STARs are RNAV and include both altitude and speed restrictions, although descent clearances are given by ATC. Oslo was also the first airport in the world to adopt a point merge system, minimizing conflicts between departing and arriving aircraft as well as reducing fuel consumption. Once within the point merge arches, aircraft can be given shortucts or vectors to join the ILS approach.

Torp Airport is a low-cost hub for airlines flying into Oslo, controlled by the Farris TMA. Despite being 110km South of Oslo, airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air insisted the airport be renamed "Oslo Torp Airport". This caused some controversy so the airport authorities decided to market the airport as "Torp Sandefjord Lufthavn", since it is located just 7km from Sandefjord.

Rygge Air Station  
22,056 annual operations  
50.4nm South of ENGM

Previously an international airport serving some low-cost airlines, Rygge Moss Airport was renamed to Rygge Air Station after it shut down to all civilian traffic on 1 November 2016. The airfield is now operated exclusively by the Royal Norwegian Air Force and controlled by the Farris TMA.

#### ENKJ
