### About Abu Dhabi International Airport
Abu Dhabi International Airport is located in the United Arab Emirates, serving the capital of the UAE. Abu Dhabi's main operator is Etihad Airways, the UAE's national flag carrier and the second largest airline within the UAE. The airport sees a fair amount of international traffic due to its location within the world; the Middle East serves as a transfer hub for travelling between Europe and the East. Despite serving the capital of the Emirates, Abu Dhabi is the 4th busiest in the Middle East.

### Sheikh Zayed Air Navigation Center
The Sheikh Zayed Air Navigation Center is located next to Abu Dhabi Airport.

Here is where communications are based alongside various units such as approach control and en-route control. The center was opened in 2009, named after Sheikh Zayed, the driving force behind the formation of the United Arab Emirates.
