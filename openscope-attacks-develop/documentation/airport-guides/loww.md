### Vienna Schwechat International Airport
Vienna (Wien) Schwechat International Airport is the largest airport in Austria, serving the Austrian capital Vienna. It is located in the town of Schwechat, 11 miles southeast of Vienna. The airport serves as a hub for Austrian Airlines and Eurowings Europe, and is a focus city for Lauda (formerly known as Laudamotion), Anisec Luftfahrt (branded as LEVEL) and Wizz Air.

The airport was originally built in 1938 as a military design and production complex. There was just one runway (11/29), which was extended in 1959, and a second runway (16/34) was built in 1972. In 2006 a new control tower was opened which allows for overview of the entire airport.

### Airspace
Wien Radar is located within the LOVV FIR, covering the area surrounding Vienna from SFC to FL245. It also controls a small area of the Budapest FIR from FL055 to FL245.

Wien Radar is surrounded by the FIRs of Vienna (LOVV), Prague (LKAA), Bratislava (LZBB) and Budapest (LHCC).

### Restricted Airspace
Aircraft departing from runway 29 make a left turn at 1,000 feet due to restricted airspace LOR-15, which lies over the city of Vienna, and extends up to FL100.

Aircraft arriving into Vienna cross through restricted airspace LOR-15 when approaching runway 11 and 16. IFR flights are allowed to enter this airspace when approaching the airport eastbound or southbound. There are other exceptions to this restriction, including VFR flights in accordance to prescribed procedures or military operations.
