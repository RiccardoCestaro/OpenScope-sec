### About this facility
Bremen Radar (HAM), Hamburg, Germany
187,741 annual operations in 2016 (Reported by Eurocontrol)

The Hamburg sector covers only a portion of Bremen Radar's control area, located 100km away from Hamburg in the city of Bremen. Although Bremen Radar controls most of the airspace in Northern Germany, the HAM sector only covers the Hamburg and Lübeck metropolitan areas.

### Airspace
The HAM sector controls a large area around Hamburg and Lübeck from the ground up to FL100, as well as a small shelf to the West which extends from FL65 to FL100; Below FL65 this area belongs to the BRE sector.
Class C and D airspace (equivalent to American class B airspace) exists on top of Hamburg and the surrounding areas up to FL100.
Of unique note here is the location of Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport (EDHI), which is less than 10km Southwest of Hamburg Airport (EDDH), right along the approach course to runway 05. Pilots sometimes confuse the two airports which has led to several incidents in the past.

### Instrument Procedures
The procedures are fairly standard for a German airport. All SID's and STAR's are RNAV and include both altitude and speed restrcitions. Despite this, climb and descent clearances will be issued by ATC. Aircraft will **not** follow the altitude restrictions in the charts. Although not required, vectors are normally used to guide aircraft to their final approach course. There are also several approach procedures which are only used in special circumstances (i.e. Loss of communications or emergencies). These procedures are not available in the sim, since such special situations are not simulated.
