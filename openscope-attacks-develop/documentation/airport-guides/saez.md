# SAEZ - Ministro Pistarini International Airport

## About SAEZ
Ministro Pistarini International Airport is named after the public works minister who proposed the construction of the airport. After receiving approval from the government to build the airport, 9 years were spent searching for the right location since the airport would have been the largest in the world at the time. It was eventually decided to build the airport in its current location due to lower construction costs than in other locations. They chose to overlook the fact that the area was prone to extreme flooding and dense fog, now a regular cause for delays at the airport. The airport was finally inaugurated in 1949 with 3 runways crossing at 60-degree angles, one of which was closed in 1997 and is now used for long-term aircraft parking.

Today, Ministro Pistarini International Airport (IATA: EZE, ICAO: SAEZ), known as Ezeiza International Airport, is Argentina's largest international airport, located 22 kilometers southwest of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. It is a hub for Aerolíneas Argentinas and LATAM Argentina. It is one of three airports serving Buenos Aires metropolitan area, along with Aeroparque Jorge Newbery (IATA: AEP, ICAO: SABE) and El Palomar Airport (IATA: EPA, ICAO: SADP). The airport is is the country's primary hub for long-haul international flights with flights to every continent, although some domestic flights also operate out of Ezeiza.

## About Baires TMA
The Baires Terminal Maneuvering Area controls a large, mostly circular area with a radius of 55nm centered at the EZE VOR and a large portion of the Río de la Plata (River Plate / La Plata River) which creates the border between Argentina and Uruguay. The TMA controls flights in and out of Buenos Aires as well as other smaller airports in nearby towns.

## Instrument Procedures
The procedures in and out of Ezeiza have remained almost identical for the last 30 years, meaning they are a little 'old-fashioned'. Most SIDs follow a 10nm arc around EZE VOR, allowing aircraft to gain some altitude before heading to their departure fixes. The only exception to this rule is the PTA6B departure for aircraft departing from Runway 11 to the East. All the STARs guide aircraft either to the EZE VOR or the Initial Approach Fix of the corresponding runway, to then be vectored onto the ILS by ATC. Procedures contain no climb or descent instructions or altitude restrictions. ATC is therefore entirely responsible for descending and climbing aircraft in and out of the airport. Special attention must be paid to arrivals from the Northeast who follow routes which take them through restricted airspace overhead Buenos Aires.
